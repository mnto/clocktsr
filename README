This repository includes 2 main programs:

The first one is CLOCK.ASM. This is a small model program written in assembly language for the 8086 machine
that continuously updates a real-time clock (hours, minutes, seconds) in the upper right corner of the screen
for as long as the program is running. 

The second one is CLOCKTSR.ASM. This functions the same way as CLOCK.ASM but is a tiny model. 
A resident routine is installed so that the clock is updated continuously until the machine is rebooted.

Both programs work so that  pressing both shift keys toggles the clock display on and off.
